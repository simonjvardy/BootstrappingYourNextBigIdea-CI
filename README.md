## Design Choices ##

### Fonts ###

We have chosen [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) from Google fonts for the entire site.

### Colours ###

We have chosen the colour that enhance and contrast the dark coloured Bootstrap theme that are appealing to the eye and also compliments the design of the project.
![Colour palette](wireframes/Whiskey-Drop-Palette.png)

- *Onyx* (444444) - Dark Grey
- *Yellow Munsell* (EEC802) - Yellow
- *Orange Soda* (F05F40) - Orange
- *Cinnabar* (DF4929) - Dark Orange

These colours will compliment each other well when used across the site creating pleasant ambience.

### Wireframes ###

We designed our site mock-ups using [balsamiq wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/). We were focusing on defining basic layout structure of the site and identifying how displays would change on different screen sizes such as [mobile](/wireframes/mobile.jpg), [tablet](/wireframes/tablet.jpg) and [desktop](/wireframes/desktop.jpg).
