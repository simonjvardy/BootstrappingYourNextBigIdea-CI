## UX (User Experience) ##

## Project Goals ##

The **goal** of this project is to build a website which ...

The features on the website will:

- Give customers more ways to interact with the shop (online bookings, social media, phone,  email)
- Enable the business to better manager the flow of customers through their premises and ensure safe conditions for all.

We achieve this by:

- Providing an option to the customers to make their **to-go** orders online
- Providing an option to the customers to **book a table** to prevent instances where the cafe it at full capacity and social distancing is not maintained.

## User Goals ##

- **Book** a table in the coffee shop for a specific time.
- **Order** a coffee **online** for collection.
- **Link** to the coffee shop social media sites.

## User Stories ##

## User Requirements and Expectations ##

- **Header**, **Main body** divided into section and **Footer**
- In the **Header** we should see a **Logo** and a **navigation bar** on the left side with option to go to:
  - **Home section** (top of the site)
  - ...
  - ...
  - **Contact us** section
- On the right side of the **Header** you should see additional ...

  - **Contact us** section displaying google maps with the coffee shop location
- In the **Footer** You should see self-explanatory icons allowing the user to connect them with the shop's social media channels.
  
## Design Choices ##

### Fonts ###

We have chosen [Josefin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans?query=jose#standard-styles) for all of the headers and [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?query=ralew#standard-styles) the rest of the text.  We have used a [Caveat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Caveat?query=caveat) font for the logo and headlines throughout the site.

### Colours ###

We have chosen the colour that say ... appealing to the eye and also compliments the design of the project.
![Colour palette](wireframes/Palette.png)

- *Grullo* (AF9483) - Light soft brown
- *Umber* (615550) - Dark brown
- *Alabaster* (F0EDE5) - Off white

These colours will compliment each other well when used across the site creating pleasant ambience.

### Wireframes ###

We designed our site mock-ups using [balsamiq wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/). We were focusing on defining basic layout structure of the site and identifying how displays would change on different screen sizes such as [mobile](/wireframes/mobile.jpg), [tablet](/wireframes/tablet.jpg) and [desktop](/wireframes/desktop.jpg).

## Credits ##

### Images ###

You can find the images used for the site [here](assets/img). We have sourced them through the Code Institute course material:

### Colour ###

We have identified the colour palette on [W3](https://www.w3schools.com/)

### Image editing ###

- We have used snippet tool for capturing screengrabs which we have saved as images.
- A handy [Birme](https://www.birme.net/?target_width=300&target_height=300&quality=100&border_width=1&border_color=%23bd3d3a) site allowed us to resise the images all at once.
